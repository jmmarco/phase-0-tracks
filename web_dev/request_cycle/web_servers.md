- What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

That the entire Unix philosophy revolves around the idea that the user knows what he or she is doing.
For example, the terminal is the most powerful and quick way to get things done in a Linux OS. Also, this powerful tool
must be used with care otherwise the entire system could be compromised. Linux assumes you know what you're doing.
Another of the important philosophies of Linux is that it's free as in Freedom, meaning that you can modify it provided you know how to. Open Source is the term that governs the source code and inner workings of Linux and it's included programs.
They are all freely available to download, modify and redistribute. The cool thing about open source is that anybody who has the capacity, can improve a piece of software. This phenomenon has lead to robust software that is sometimes a lot better than private software solutions made by companies. It's also has a modular design that makes it lightweight and flexible.

- In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is virtual machine that runs an operating system and is typically sold as a service by a company that provides Internet hosting services. A VPS is capable of running a single or multiple operating systems; they can be fully customized by the customer provided he/she has the knowledge to do so. Since they are virtual, they are easier to setup and configure than an ordinary hardware only solution.

- Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
Running programs as root can lead to unexpected results and could sometimes (depending on the program) modify or damage areas of the OS without confirmation. For example running "rm -rf" as root can recursively and forcefully remove a directory in a blink of an eye with no confirmation whatsoever.
