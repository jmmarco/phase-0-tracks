Release 0: Equip Your New Robot
It's the year 2030, and you've finally acquired a Personal Robot to do your bidding. Huzzah!

Unfortunately, your robot doesn't know how to use an elevator.

Elevator pseudocode:

- Scan elevator keypad to figure out how many floors there are and store them.
- Alert the user by issuing a voice command: "Ready, which floor would you like to go?":
	- Until a response is heard
		If response is valid floor number:
			- Issue voice command: "Sure thing Boss!"
			- Press button for target floor
		Else
		 	- Issue voice command: "Sorry, that floor doesn't exist"
		 	- Issue voice command: "Valid floors for this building are [1,2,3...]"

	- If no response is heard
		- Repeat initial voice command: "Ready, which floor would you like to go"
